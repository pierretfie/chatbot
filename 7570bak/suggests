Awesome — thanks for sharing the complete implementation and the output! You're **so close** to a successful GPU run, but it looks like the GPU kernel **didn't find the password**, even though the CPU did — and very quickly.

Let’s break this down and debug step-by-step.

---

## 🔍 Issue Summary

- **Target password:** `'0000'`
- **CPU found it immediately** (1st guess).
- **GPU ran all 10,000 keys** but **did not detect a match**.
- OpenCL kernel compiled and executed without error.
- Performance is low (927 hashes/sec) — possibly due to Mesa/Clover being CPU-emulated or misoptimized.

---

## 🔧 Likely Causes

### ✅ Compilation success means syntax and logic *should* be okay.
But...

### ❌ Kernel **doesn't detect a match**
That typically points to:
1. **Mismatch in MD5 digest format**:
   - Host `hashlib.md5` generates **16-byte digest (big endian)**.
   - Kernel compares `uint[4]` using a manual little-endian unpack.
   - There's potential endianness/packing mismatch.

2. **Buffer alignment issues** (unlikely with your clean usage of `np.uint8`).

3. **Incorrect or partial padding in the kernel**.
   - Your GPU MD5 padding logic looks sound, but worth double-checking.

4. **Early-exit flag not synchronizing properly**.
   - You mentioned: `// WARNING: No atomic operation available/working.`

---

## ✅ What *Is* Working

- Everything compiles, runs, and doesn't crash.
- OpenCL 1.1 is detected, so `atom_cmpxchg()` *should* be usable.

---

## 🧪 Suggested Fixes & Tests

### ✅ 1. **Verify MD5 Comparison on GPU**

Replace the `compare_hash_uint()` with a **byte-by-byte comparison** to rule out endian mismatch:

```c
inline int compare_hash(__private uint* computed, __global const uchar* target) {
    uchar* computed_bytes = (uchar*)computed;
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {
        if (computed_bytes[i] != target[i]) return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
```

Update the call:
```c
if (compare_hash(hash_state, target_hash)) {
    // rest of match logic...
}
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Make `result_found[0]` update atomic**

If your Clover device supports OpenCL 1.1+ **and** `atom_cmpxchg()`, use it:
```c
if (compare_hash(...)) {
    if (atom_cmpxchg(&result_found[0], 0, 1) == 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i < password_len; ++i) {
            found_password[i] = current_password[i];
        }
        found_password[password_len] = 0;
    }
}
```
This prevents race conditions.

---

### ✅ 3. **Print the first generated password (optional debug)**

You can insert a small snippet to verify if the kernel is producing correct guesses:

```c
if (gid == 0) {
    // DEBUG: store first password candidate in found_password for inspection
    for (int i = 0; i < password_len; ++i) {
        found_password[i] = current_password[i];
    }
}
```

Then inspect `found_password_host` even if no match is found — see if it holds `"0000"`.

---

### ✅ 4. **Fallback: Match `hashlib.md5` manually**

If nothing else works, precompute `TARGET_HASH_BYTES` in Python as a `uint32[4]` (little-endian), then compare `hash_state[]` directly.

```python
# e.g.
import struct
expected_gpu_hash = struct.unpack('<4I', TARGET_HASH_BYTES)
print("Expected GPU-side uint32 hash:", expected_gpu_hash)
```

Then you can **hardcode that value** in the OpenCL kernel temporarily for testing.

## 🔚 Summary: Recommended Next Steps

| Step | Fix |
|------|-----|
| ✅ | Replace `compare_hash_uint()` with simple byte loop |
| ✅ | Use `atom_cmpxchg()` for safe flag setting |
| ✅ | Dump first candidate password to validate generation |
| ⏳ | If still no match: manually inspect and compare hashes (Python + OpenCL) |
